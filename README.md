# Arduino-humidity-and-temperature-with-DHT11-and-LCD1602-Module
Simple code made for fun where both components are used to show actual values of humidity and temperature to a LCD module and to show on serial the temperature every 5 seconds

The project was made to log the temperatures of my workplace to prove that the AC unit was broken. I used Putty as a serial monitor, since Putty can store log files. The setup of the project is included as a photo.

Componentes used:
10k Ohm resistor
thermistor
potentiometer 10k
830-tie points breadboard
DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
LC 1602 Module
Mega 2560 Controller Board

IDE used: Arduino Software IDE
